# Facial Feature Extraction
I have extracted features using a standard dataset available online and stored them as a CSV file. I have written a program that calculates the facial features by capturing one's face via webcam.

Dataset - SCUTFBP5500. This Dataset contains 2000 images of Asian males and females each, and 750 images of Caucasian mlaes and females each. Each image has been rated by several volunteers which is used as labels. Link to the dataset - https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release

I have built a Regression and Classification Model to predict ratings of faces. The models are saved as joblib files.

The codes and CSV files of extracted features can be found in the respective folders. 

I HOPE YOU ENJOYED!!!
